A brief about myself:

I am currently involved in Data & Analytics projects which involves using Oracle, SQL Server, MarkitEDM, SSIS tools/application, along the way I am learning Python, Power BI as well.

I am looking to collabrate with folks who can guide me learning new tips and tricks related to Python and Power BI, which I can blend with my current work and make the end results even more meanigful.
